## ♻ How does this plugin work?

This plugin acts as a bridge between platforms, using Triggers and Actions. Triggers capture data, like form submissions (Contact Form 7, WP Forms, etc.), while Actions send it to CRM, Email Marketing Software, Project Management Tools, Data Collection Tools, and other WordPress plugins.
For example, a contact form (Bit Form, WP Forms, etc.)
is submitted, and you want to send data in your CRM, Email Marketing Software, Project Management Tools, Data Collection Tools, and Other WordPress plugins.

== ❣ What our customer say about Bit Integrations : ==

[` 💠 Best of class`](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/best-of-class-with-few-glitches/)

I have tested a lot of integrators/automators, like AutomatorWP, Uncanny Automator, Thrive Automator and SureTriggers … what can I say:
Bit Integrations integrates with the widest range of plugins & services among all ⭐

-by @saschinger

[` 💠 Bit Integrations is an affordable alternative to Pabbly Connect and Zapier`](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/bit-integrations-is-an-affordable-alternative-to-pabbly-and-zapier/)

Bit Integrations is an easy-to-install and easy-to-use automation plug-in that handles many functions that we would normally have to pay large monthly or annual fees (for Pabbly Connect or Zapier). Check out their list of integrations and see if it can save you dollars too!

-by @barrynthdegreegroupnet

[` 💠 A Game Changer for My WordPress automation`](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-game-changer-for-my-wordpress-automation/)

“I’ve been using Bit Integrations for a few months now, and it’s been a game changer for my business. The wide range of integrations available has allowed me to connect Bit with a variety of external tools and services, making it much easier to automate my workflows and streamline my work processes

-by @angelitos

[` 💠 Zapier-like Integrations, No Fees Required!`](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/zapier-like-integrations-without-the-fees/)

The rich WordPress ecosystem can be integrated without paying the high cost of Zapier.

-by @peterode

[` 💠 Zapier for WordPress Made Easy!`](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/zapier-for-wordpress/)

I’ve been using the pro version to automate many tasks from Gravity Forms, Restrict Content Pro and FluentCRM. Easy to set up and runs on your own site.

-by @onedogsolutions

[` 💠 Great Product and Great Support!!`](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-product-and-great-support-54/)
Tech Support for Bit Integrations just helped me resolve a difficulty I was having getting started. The process of setting up an integration couldn’t be simpler but my Formidable Form wasn’t updating my WooCommerce Product. It turned out that I was doing the Formidable Form update in the Dashboard rather than in Preview mode. Support couldn’t have been nicer about working through discovering the problem.
Not only am I a fan of the support, I’ve become a big fan of the integration product. What could be better, transparent synching of my Formidable Form with WooCommerce with absolutely minimal resource usage, just when I need to add or modify a Product. Perfect!

-by @jamesmarnell

[` 💠 Brilliant and Easy to use`](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/brilliant-and-easy-to-use-14/)

This plugins works very well. The are always releasing updates and new integrations. The plugin is easy to use and works brilliantly!

-by @marcelobacchi

[` 💠 Pure Automation at Play!`](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/pure-automation-at-play/)

This is an amazing plugin. The premium version allows you to automate close to 100+ popular apps in the market. The library is growing and the developers are active adding integrations every month.
With incoming and outgoing webhooks, you can literally automate a lot of stuff. This can totally replace Zapier and other automation tools inside WordPress as conditional logic is also included.
My typical use-case: Adding WooCommerce orders to Gsheets and then sending the lead info to ActiveCampaign along with tags.

-by @vaishakdamu
